10.4.2 XDE Usage
================

In the 10.4.2 XDE you cannot use EGit but you can import projects once you have cloned them to a working directory using git. 
To do this go to File \> Import \> General \> Existing Projects Into Workspace. Click on Select root directory and then 
click on Browse. If you then select the repository directory you should be able to import a project representing the repository.
