Planned Developments
====================

The community could benefit from several features:

* Automated builds, where repositories are automatically built regularly (eg, daily), registering build failures.

* Automated regressions, where repositories are automatically tested regularly (eg daily), logging test failures and other metrics (code coverage for example).

Outcomes of these may help to determine long term stability and quality of the repositories, and will therefore assist community members in deciding whether to include the products of a repo in their own design.  Any results will be summarised on the [[Repository status page]].
