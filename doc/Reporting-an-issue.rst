Reporting an issue
==================

The Xcore open source project uses the built-in github issue tracking capabilities (primarily for bugs and contributions of new code). If you’ve found a bug in any of the repositories, this is the place to start.  Bugs in most recent versions of a design are likely to get the most attention. Also, the xcore team is always interested in feedback from those who can take the time to test the head of the mainline. 

Creating a Bug Report
---------------------

If you’ve found a problem with a repository, you can start by checking existing issues to make sure that the issue hasn't already been reported. If it hasn't, click on the "issue" button in the github repo dashboard. At the minimum, your ticket needs a title and descriptive text. But that’s only a minimum. You should include as much relevant information as possible. Submitting a testcase that shows how the expected behaviour is not occurring and/or proposes a fix is always appreciated.

There is no attachment model, but you can easily fork the repository
you are submitting an issue to, and provide a link to the fork, which
would appear under your own public github account. Any changes,
additional test etc required to highlight the problem can then be
applied in the fork. See `this github help page <https://github.com/blog/270-the-fork-queue>`_ for more details. 

Then don’t get your hopes up. Unless you have a “Code Red, Mission Critical, The World is Coming to an End” kind of bug, you’re creating this ticket in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the ticket automatically will see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a ticket like this is mostly to help yourself start on the path of fixing the problem and for others to confirm it with a “I’m having this problem too” comment.

What About Feature Requests?
----------------------------

If there’s a new feature that you want to see added to an Xcore repository (or indeed a new component or design), you’ll need to write the code yourself – or convince someone else to partner with you to write the code. If you enter a wishlist issue in a repo with no code, you can expect it to be marked “invalid” as soon as it’s reviewed. There is however, nothing to stop you creating a new forum topic enquiring politely about the roadmap for a specific component.
