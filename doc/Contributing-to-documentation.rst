Contributing to documentation
=============================

Another area where you can help out if youâ€™re not yet ready to take the plunge to writing code is with documentation. Either this wiki, or repository documentation.

The Xcore open source documenation
----------------------------------

This documentation is stored in the 
`Community repo <http://github.com/xcore/Community>`_. You can raise a
fork and raise pull request against it. It uses `xdoc <http://github.com/xcore/xdoc>`_ to build the documentation.

Design documentation
--------------------

Design documentation for specific repos is contained in those repos themselves.
