Participating in the Community
==============================

This section discusses the various ways that you may contribute to the project.  Firstly:

*	If you are not already a member of the Xcore community, please
	go to http://www.xcore.com/) and sign up - we are using the forums there for discussions.
*	If you do not already have a github login, then you are going
	to need one of those too - it is free and you can do it at https://github.com/signup/micro.  At the moment, there is no link between your xcore login and the github repository (yawn), so please (please) update your profile on xcore to identify who you are on github.

You are now in a position to make a real difference.  Even if you donâ€™t feel up to writing code yet, there are a variety of other ways that you can contribute, from reporting issues to testing patches to contributing documentation:

*  :doc:`Reporting-an-issue` describes how to report an issue with a repository
*  :doc:`Resolving-existing-issues` describes a great way to get started with community contribution
*  :doc:`Contributing-to-documentation` describes how to contribute to community and design documentation
*  :doc:`Contributing-to-the-codebase` describes how to make a contribution to one of the existing repositories
*  :doc:`Repository-management` describes how to create a new repository

Last but not least, please remember that despite the online nature of the Xcore open source project and the human contact abstraction that results from that fact, it is important to realize that there are real people at the end of all contributions. Treat all other community members as you would expect to be treated. Review the contribution, not the contributor; don't annoy others, and don't become easily annoyed yourself.
