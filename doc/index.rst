XCore open source community documentation
=========================================

Welcome to the Xcore open source project wiki. This project is
envisaged to consist of a diverse range of software, hardware and
tools which are targeted at XMOS technology. We hope you'll find
some great ideas here, and perhaps add some of your own.

    This wiki is still at the proposal stage, so if you want to suggest
    changes, please contribute to the `Xcore open source project user forum <https://www.xcore.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=32>`_.



If you are new to this project, you might want to take a look at
these pages:

-  :doc:`About-the-community` explains what the community is about,
   XMOS' position within it, and the community roles and
   responsibilities.
-  :doc:`About-the-repositories` explains the types of repositories,
   their structure, the way in which they are managed, versioning
   policy and the status of the current content.
-  :doc:`Participating-in-the-community` explains how to contribute to
   the documentation, issue tracking and codebase and the roles that
   exist within the community.
-  :doc:`About-XMOS-technology` provides some links to technical
   documentation you may want to read and describes XMOS' role and
   intentions for the community.
-  :doc:`Planned-developments` outlines some of the capabilities and
   services XMOS and the community plan to contribute to the Xcore
   open source project in the future.

Enjoy yourselves and remember, this is an open source community
site - if you see something that could be improved, or is plain old
broken, please consider fixing it yourself before raising an
issue.

Thanks.
