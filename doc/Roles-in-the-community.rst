Roles in the Community
======================

The recognised roles within the community are given below. If you feel
that there should be more (or fewer!) roles defined, feel free to
contribute to the `Xcore open source project user forum <https://www.xcore.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=32)>`_.

Whole Community Roles
---------------------

Community manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where required, the community manager has final say on any disputes.  In theory this could extend from pull-requests to policy, but we expect that most technical issues will not require community manager intervention.  In the first instance, it is the community manager's responsibility to set up repositories and grant individuals access to repositories under the XCore organization in github. 

For the time being the community manager will be an XMOS employee.  Although it is XMOS intention that this role should eventually be an external individual.

The current community manager is `davelxmos <https://github.com/davelxmos>`_.

Per Repository Roles
--------------------

Individuals fulfilling the following roles must all have agreed the
`contributor license agreement <https://www.xcore.com/OpenSourceAgreement>`_.  Having done this an individual becomes eligible to commit.  To actually start committing code, they must then request a repository (see :doc:`Repository-management`), or be invited to be a committer on an existing repository.

Release manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This individual determines the contents, schedule and ultimately readiness of a release of a particular repository.

Maintainers
~~~~~~~~~~~

These individuals have the responsibility to accept "pull requests" and to push the updated branch of a particular repository.  This implies that the maintainer has reviewed the proposed changes, discussed any refinements with the originator of the pull request, and finally merged the code changes.  The maintainer's primary responsibility to their mainline is, first and foremost, to do no harm(!).  For the time being it is proposed that the release manager and maintainer are the same individual.  Anyone can be a maintainer of their own line, or, from time to time, a new maintainer may have to be found for an existing line.  The maintainer's name for each repository can be found on the :doc:`repo-index`.

Committers
~~~~~~~~~~

From time to time, maintainers may wish to nominate committers to their repository.  They can do this by creating an issue on the Community repository.  

Committers have the same rights and responsibilities as maintainers to administer pull requests from other contributors.
